# BabyGPTs üçº : A simple implementation of GPTS

[**issue‚ùì**](https://github.com/5663015/BabyGPTs/issues) | [disscussionsüí¨](https://github.com/5663015/BabyGPTs/discussions)

## üí° Introduction

BabyGPTs üçº is a very simple implementation of OpenAI GPTs. It's current principle is to generate GPTs system instructions according to user's input, combined with custom tools, to achieve the construction of GPTs.

The main features of BabyGPTs are:

- üìù Natural language interaction to create GPTs.
- üé® Generation of GPTs Logo, name, description and conversation starters.
- üîß HuggingFace Inference API as tools.

### Architecture üìÅ

The architecture of BabyGPTs is shown as follows.

The BabyGPTs includes two main parts: GPTs builder and GPTs. GPTs builder can generate config JSON of GPTs according user's input, including GPTs' name, description, system instruction, conversation startes and logo prompt. And user can also define HuggingFace Inference API config, so that GPTs can call these APIs as tools. Then the GPTs can be created by config JSON and tools config. Finally, you can chat with your created GPTs.

### News üéâ

- **[2023-11-28]:** We released the first version of BabyGPTs.

### TODO üìã

- [ ] Support GPTs export, and standalone UI for GPTs.
- [ ] Support Assistants API (Code Interpreter and Retrieval can be used)
- [ ] Support image upload and doc upload
- [ ] Support for more types of tools
- [ ] More complex agents, including planning capabilities

## üíª Get started

1. Prepare OpenAI API KEY and [HuggingFace Access Tokens](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens) (use for HF API KEY).
2. prepare python environment

```bash
pip install -r resuirements.txt
```

3. Set `.env` file. Change `.env_example` to `.env`, and write your `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_BASE`, `OPENAI_MODEL` and `HF_API_KEY`.

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=
OPENAI_BASE=
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
HF_API_KEY=
```

3. Run webui

```bash
python webui.py
```

4. Input your requirements of GPTs in GPTs Builder chatbot.

5. (Optional) Perfect  and change the generated config.

6. Add the necessary tools. You should input model_url and model description, and select model_type correctly. Then input model's parameters, including `param_name`, `type`, `description` and `required`. `requied`  indicates whether this parameter is required. Then click `add tool` button, the added tools are shown in HF tools list. You can select which tools to use in GPTs. Some reference tools can be found below.

NOTE: `model_url` is HuggingFace Inference API, NOT the url in the browser.

7. Click `Preview GPTs` button to build GPTs, and you can chat with your created GPTs.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitation

Note that the BabyGPTs is only a very simple implementation of OpenAI GPTs, which only contains the tool call ability in the agent, and does not have complex memory, task planning and other modules. Therefore, BabyGPTs may not be able to handle with complex requirements, and the GPTs you create may not exactly meet your expectations.
